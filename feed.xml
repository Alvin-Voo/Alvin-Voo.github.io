Traditional education has taught us to ‘fill in the blanks’ or ‘write a 1000 words essay’ in which we had to conjure up extra words to get those few extra points.&lt;br /&gt;
This creates a habit out of us where we had to make up ‘fillers’ in real life. Our mind has been conditioned to think that we &lt;em&gt;need to&lt;/em&gt; have more to offer than what we actually have.&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, we &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT NEED TO&lt;/strong&gt; puff ourselves up, and make up words where there’s none.&lt;br /&gt;
Just be straight to the point.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="ethics" /><category term="efficiency" /><summary type="html">Being succinct and precise saves the day.</summary></entry></feed>
